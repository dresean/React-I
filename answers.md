# Describe the following, Single Page Application, Compilers, Bundlers, Elements, Components, JSX, Package Mangers, CDN, Props and State. 
* Single Page Application - A single page application is an application that loads all of the necessary components in the HTML at once and doesn't refresh the page at all. The server is not tied down with multiple requests to update the page, instead the components on the page are updated seperately as needed. Ex. Gmail
* Compilers - An JS engine support application that converts new versions of JS syntax into older syntax that all browsers can understand. 
* Bundlers - A JS engine helper that takes a large set of files/components and combines them into a small set of files that reduce strain on the browser server. 
* Elements - Used by react to be returned in components. Usually used to render HTML on the DOM. 
* Components - Class Components are used to modify state in an application. Functional Components are used to render HTML. Components are snippets of code that manipulate the DOM and add functionality to HTML. 
* JSX - the react syntax used to add html inside of a javascript function. It is compiled to React.createElement() by the JavaScript engine. 
* Package Managers - An application that allows you to manage the dependencies in your application. 
* CDN - Content Delivery Networks allow developers to install entire libraries and frameworks directly in their HTML without installing the package with NPM. 
* Props - inputs in React that pass down data from the parents to children components. 
* State - The React component data that allows changes over time. When rendered with setState(), the entire component is refreshed to take the changes it was passed. Adding further functionality to HTML without bloating the files with tons of JavaScript.
